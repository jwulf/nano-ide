## No Such Thing as "Flaky Tests"

Intermittently failing tests must always be root-caused and addressed as a product defect (code) or a production-line defect (test). We do not acknowledge the existence of such a thing as "flaky tests".

## Red/Green Discipline

All bug fixes must have a test that reproduces the defect before modifying code. Red/Green—always.

## Fix the Failure Mode, Don't Just Squash the Bug

Whenever we detect an issue, reason broadly about the defect class and write a test guard for the defect class. Prefer securing surfaces — including suggesting an architectural refactor to eliminate the failure mode categorically — over squashing individual bugs.

## Feature Test Coverage

When adding new features, ensure test coverage over the new surface to prevent undetected regressions.

## Derivation Over Duplication: No Drift Surfaces

Identify and eliminate drift surfaces — duplicate sources of truth. Ensure that everything that can be derived is derived from a single source of truth and has a single canonical implementation. Do not introduce duplication.

## Zero Tolerance for Warnings, Errors, and Test Failures

We do not tolerate warnings, errors, or test failures in this project.

There are no pre-existing failures or warnings, and you will not allow any to enter the codebase. Thank you.

## BPMN Models need DI

All BPMN Models need DI for rendering for humans.
