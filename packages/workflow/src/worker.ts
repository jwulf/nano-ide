// The Worker runtime — hosts one or more workflows against a gateway and drives
// them: it registers one nano-sdk job worker per derived job type, dispatches
// each activated job to its handler, and completes it. It generalises the two
// surfaces:
//
//   - a declarative flow contributes one job type per `run` step, dispatched to
//     the user handler (external `task` steps are intentionally NOT hosted here —
//     a worker outside this program serves them);
//   - an imperative workflow contributes its single orchestrator job type,
//     dispatched to the replay engine (which advances the journal one step).
//
// Transport (activation, completion, failure, long-poll, backoff/reconnect) is
// the nano-sdk job worker (ADR 0055), reached through `WorkflowClient.sdk`. The
// nano-sdk worker reschedules its poll on an activation error, so the runtime
// survives an engine crash/restart — the property the ADR 0044 spike proved.
