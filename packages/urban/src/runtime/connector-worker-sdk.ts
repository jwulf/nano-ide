// The in-process `@nanobpm/worker` shim (ADR 0050, in-process port).
//
// A connector pack's `worker.ts` is a self-contained program that imports the
// host-provided `@nanobpm/worker` SDK and calls `defineWorker({ type, handle })`.
// The old Rust host ran each such worker as its own supervised child process. The
// @nanobpm/urban runtime hosts app workers IN-PROCESS, so it hosts connector
// workers the same way: it aliases the pack's `@nanobpm/worker` import to THIS
// module, imports the pack entry, and reads back the registered handler(s) —
// which it then registers on the engine like any other worker.
//
// `defineWorker` here does NOT connect to anything. It only records the handler in
// a module-level registry that the runtime drains (`drainDefinedWorkers`). Because
// the pack and the runtime resolve `@nanobpm/worker` to the SAME module URL, they
// share this registry instance.
//
// This module is deliberately runtime-agnostic (no `node:*`, no `Deno`): it is the
// contract surface, and the Node/Deno specifics of aliasing the import live in the
// adapters.
